# Project Proposal: Integrated Economic and Financial Data Analysis System

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Economic and Financial Data Analysis System

**Objective:** To develop an integrated system that retrieves, stores, and analyzes economic and financial data from multiple sources to identify and correlate cause-and-effect relationships between various economic indicators and financial market trends. The system will also overlay significant government interventions, such as changes in interest rates, tax breaks, and currency policies, to provide a comprehensive view of market dynamics.

**Key Features:**
1. **Data Retrieval:** Automate the retrieval of historical and daily economic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) and financial data from Alpha Vantage.
2. **Data Storage:** Store the retrieved data in Trino tables backed by S3 Iceberg tables for efficient and scalable storage.
3. **Data Analysis:** Perform advanced data analysis to uncover insights and correlations using statistical methods.
4. **Overlay Government Interventions:** Integrate significant government events and policies to overlay them on economic and financial data visualizations.
5. **Credit Card Volume and Delinquency Analysis:** Incorporate strategies to analyze credit card volume and delinquency using data from FRED or Alpha Vantage.
6. **Large Dataset Integration:** Ensure at least one dataset has a large footprint (over a million rows) to meet final exam targets.
7. **Future Integration:** Incorporate Apache Spark, Flink, and Kafka for real-time data processing, streaming, and enhanced analytical capabilities.

## Background and Motivation

Understanding the interplay between economic indicators and financial markets is crucial for making informed decisions in finance, economics, and policy-making. Traditional methods of data analysis often lack the ability to dynamically update and process large volumes of data in real-time. Additionally, government interventions can significantly impact market dynamics. This project aims to bridge these gaps by leveraging modern data processing technologies to create a robust, scalable, and real-time capable system.

## Project Components

1. **Data Retrieval**
    - **FRED API:** Fetch historical and daily updates for macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, inflation rates, employment rates, etc.
    - **Alpha Vantage API:** Retrieve historical and daily updates for financial market data such as stock prices (e.g., S&P 500), interest rates, and exchange rates.
    - **Intraday Stock Prices:** Fetch minute-by-minute or hourly stock prices for major indices or stocks to ensure a large dataset.
    - **Credit Card Data:** Retrieve data on credit card volume and delinquency rates from FRED or Alpha Vantage.

2. **Data Storage**
    - **Trino and S3 Iceberg Tables:** Utilize Trino for querying large datasets and S3 Iceberg tables for efficient, scalable storage.
    - **Apache Airflow:** Automate the data retrieval and storage processes using Airflow DAGs to ensure data is updated daily.

3. **Data Analysis**
    - **Correlation Analysis:** Use statistical methods to identify relationships between economic indicators and financial market performance.
    - **Visualization:** Create visualizations to depict these relationships and make insights easily understandable.
    - **Overlay Government Interventions:** Integrate data on government policies and significant events, such as interest rate changes, tax breaks, and currency policies, and overlay them on visualizations to provide context to the data.
    - **Credit Card Analysis:** Analyze credit card volume and delinquency trends and correlate them with other economic indicators.

4. **Future Integration and Enhancements**
    - **Apache Spark:** Incorporate Spark for large-scale data processing and advanced analytics.
    - **Apache Flink:** Utilize Flink for real-time data streaming and processing, enabling near real-time analytics and insights.
    - **Apache Kafka:** Integrate Kafka for reliable and scalable data streaming, ensuring seamless data flow between various components of the system.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Initial Setup and Data Retrieval**
    - Set up Apache Airflow and configure DAGs for data retrieval from FRED and Alpha Vantage.
    - Establish Trino and S3 Iceberg table infrastructure for data storage.
    - Develop and test Python scripts for fetching and storing data.

2. **Phase 2: Data Analysis and Visualization**
    - Implement preprocessing and alignment of data from different sources.
    - Perform correlation analysis to identify significant relationships.
    - Create visualizations to represent the findings.
    - Integrate and overlay government interventions on the visualizations.
    - Implement strategies to analyze credit card volume and delinquency data.

3. **Phase 3: Future Integration with Spark, Flink, and Kafka**
    - Set up Apache Spark for batch processing and advanced analytics.
    - Integrate Apache Flink for real-time data processing and analytics.
    - Utilize Apache Kafka for reliable data streaming between components.

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Deployment**
    - Conduct thorough testing of all components and ensure seamless integration.
    - Deploy the system in a production environment.
    - Monitor and maintain the system, ensuring it runs smoothly and efficiently.

## Potential Use Cases

1. **Real-Time Economic Monitoring:** Continuously monitor and analyze the economic indicators and financial markets to provide real-time insights for economists, policymakers, and financial analysts.
2. **Predictive Analytics:** Use historical data to develop predictive models that forecast future economic and financial trends.
3. **Risk Management:** Help financial institutions and businesses manage risk by understanding the impact of economic changes on financial markets.
4. **Investment Strategies:** Inform investment strategies by identifying correlations between macroeconomic indicators and market performance.
5. **Policy Impact Analysis:** Evaluate the impact of government interventions on the economy and financial markets, providing valuable insights for policy-making.
6. **Credit Card Risk Analysis:** Assess credit card volume and delinquency trends to inform risk management strategies for financial institutions.

## Conclusion
